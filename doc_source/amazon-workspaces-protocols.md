| Amazon WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol \(WSP\) WorkSpaces are available as a beta service and are subject to change\. WSP beta WorkSpaces should not be used for production workloads\. For more information about the WSP beta, see [Amazon WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol \(beta\)](http://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/wsp/)\. | 

Amazon WorkSpaces supports two protocols: PCoIP and WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol \(WSP\) beta\. Which protocol you choose depends on several factors, such as the type of devices your users will be accessing their WorkSpaces from, which operating system is on your WorkSpaces, what network conditions your users will be facing, and whether your users require bidirectional video support\.

The two protocols offer the following features:

**PCoIP**
+ Supports Teradici zero client devices\.
+ Supports Windows 7, 10, and Linux WorkSpaces\.

**WSP beta**
+ Allows users to still be productive at global distances and under uncertain network conditions\.
+ Supports bidirectional video and webcams\.
+ Supports Windows 10 WorkSpaces\.
