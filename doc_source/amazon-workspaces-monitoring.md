You can use the following features to monitor your WorkSpaces\.

**CloudWatch metrics**  
Amazon WorkSpaces publishes data points to Amazon CloudWatch about your WorkSpaces\.

You can use these metrics to verify that your WorkSpaces are performing as expected\. For more information, see [Monitor Your WorkSpaces Using CloudWatch Metrics](cloudwatch-metrics.md)\.

**CloudWatch events**  
Amazon WorkSpaces can submit events to Amazon CloudWatch Events when users log in to your WorkSpace\. This enables you to respond when the event occurs\. For more information, see [Monitor Your WorkSpaces Using CloudWatch Events](cloudwatch-events.md)\.
