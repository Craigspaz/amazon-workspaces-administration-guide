# WorkSpace Bundles and Images<a name="amazon-workspaces-bundles"></a>

A *WorkSpace bundle* is a combination of an operating system, and storage, compute, and software resources\. When you launch a WorkSpace, you select the bundle that meets your needs\. For more information, see [Amazon WorkSpaces Bundles](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/details/#Amazon_WorkSpaces_Bundles)\.

You can create an image from a Windows or Amazon Linux WorkSpace that you've customized, create a *custom WorkSpace bundle* from the image, and launch WorkSpaces from your custom bundle\. By creating a custom bundle, you can ensure that the WorkSpaces for your users have everything that they need already installed\. If you need to perform software updates or install additional software on your WorkSpaces, you can update your custom bundle and rebuild your WorkSpaces\.
