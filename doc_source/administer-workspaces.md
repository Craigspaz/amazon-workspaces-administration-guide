# Administer Your WorkSpaces<a name="administer-workspaces"></a>

You can administer your WorkSpaces using the Amazon WorkSpaces console\.

Amazon WorkSpaces schedules maintenance for your WorkSpaces\. During the maintenance window, we download and install important updates\. For AlwaysOn WorkSpaces, the maintenance window is each Sunday morning, from 00:00 to 04:00 in the time zone of the AWS region for the WorkSpace\. During this time, your WorkSpaces might be unavailable\. For AutoStop WorkSpaces, you can enable maintenance mode or install updates manually\. For more information, see [Set Maintenance Mode](running-mode.md#set-maintenance-mode)\.
