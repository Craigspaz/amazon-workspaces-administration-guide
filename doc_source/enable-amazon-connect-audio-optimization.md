# Enable Amazon Connect audio optimization for your users<a name="enable-amazon-connect-audio-optimization"></a>

In the WorkSpaces management console, you can enable Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) audio optimization for your WorkSpaces fleets to enhance security and to enable native\-quality audio\. After enabling CCP audio optimization, the CCP audio will be processed by the client endpoints, while WorkSpaces users can interact with the CCP from within their WorkSpaces\.

Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) audio optimization works with:
+ The WorkSpaces Windows client\.
+ Amazon Linux and Windows WorkSpaces\.
+ WorkSpaces using PCoIP or WSP\.

## Requirements<a name="amazon-connect-audio-optimization-requirements"></a>
+ You must be set up with Amazon Connect\.
+ You must build a custom CCP with the Amazon Connect Stream API by creating a CCP with no media for call signaling\. This way, the media is handled on the local desktop using standard CCP, and the signaling and call controls are handled on the remote connection with the CCP with no media\. For more information about the Amazon Connect streams API, see the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/aws/amazon-connect-streams](https://github.com/aws/amazon-connect-streams)\. The custom CCP that you build is the CCP your Amazon Connect agents will use within their WorkSpaces\.
+ You must have a web browser installed onto WorkSpaces client endpoints that's supported by Amazon Connect\. For the list of supported browsers, see [ Browsers supported by Amazon Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/browsers.html)\.
**Note**  
If your users use browsers that are not supported, they will be asked to download a supported browser when they attempt to log in to the CCP\.
